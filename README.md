# Space-Invaders

We have remodeled and recreated the nostalgic game from the 70's. The principle behind the working of the project,<b> Space Invaders</b>, is based on the Collision Detection. This is a game project, where there is a aircraft loaded with weapons. We make use of the gun to target the enemy before the heap crosses the safe line .Each shot with accuracy give the points to player. Score is displayed as well as overall high score. Alomg with the numerous features we have developed, the game has a variety of difficulty levels.<br>

## Implementation
We have made use of C with OpenGl for entire coding purpose along with some features of Windows. The OpenGl Utility is a Programming Interface. The toolkit supports much functionality like multiple window rendering, callback event driven processing using sophisticated input devices etc.

<b>PSA</b>: We have made use of the Code::Blocks 20.03 IDE, hence the project is contained an .cbp file.
